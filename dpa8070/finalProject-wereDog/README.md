### Objective:
#### Choose a focus: advanced modeling, advanced texturing/shading/lighting/rendering, advanced animation, advanced rigging, or e?ects. Your project needs to either explore a topic we did not tackle in a class project or go beyond what we did in a previous project. You can use any of our previous models (or ?nd other assets but always cite your sources). Your ?nal movie should be saved in standard format (e.g., .mov), minimum size 800x600 but 1024x768 is preferred.

### Solution:
#### For my project, I focused on advanced modeling by way of importing one of my past Zbrush projects into Maya, and then I also wanted to make an advanced rig to control it. Finally, I made an interesting animation to demonstrate some of the capabilities of the rig. Shading and lighting are relatively basic in this example, but the shading for the ground, wood, and clothing are all procedurally generated with Mix shaders and creative use of noise textures.

#### Additionally, I created a good set of UVs manually through Maya's UV editor for the main body mesh to allow easier detailing of the skin in Substance Painter. This was primarily done to create some distinction between the finger nails, toe nails, inner mouth bag, eye bags, nose, and hand/foot pads. Here is what the resulting UV and Substance Painter result look like:
