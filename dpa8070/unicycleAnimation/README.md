### Objective:
#### Create an animation of a unicycle lasting 10-20 seconds. Create a rig to animate your unicycle. You are free to be as creative as you like with the animation. Try to make the final product entertaining. Also, incorporate some of the Disney 12 animation principles.

### Solution:
#### I chose to animate an articulate unicycle, with an "animated" personality that exudes confidence. I wanted to give this character a semi-realistic apearance through the use of arnold shaders and give it an interesting environment to fit that.  From this, I contructed a small world with a ground plane, tree stump, and a more interesting skybox.
