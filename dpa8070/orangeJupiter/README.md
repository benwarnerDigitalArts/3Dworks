## Exercise 9: Shading and Lighting - an Orange and Jupiter
### Date: October 7th, 2020

### Objective:
Create realistice Shading and Lighting for basic models (spheres) of an orange and Jupiter.

### Solution:
#### I found a similar solution for both scenarios, primarily making use of basic Blinn shaders with colors driven by ramps.
