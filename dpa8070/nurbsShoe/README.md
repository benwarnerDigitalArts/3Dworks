## Project 1: Recreate a Shoe using NURBS!
### Date: Spetember 28th, 2020

### Objective:
From a single image, recreate a shoe using only (or mostly) NURBS and related tools.

### Solution:
#### This shoe is primarily composed of birail #1 surfaces that are then extruded to create a form.  Most notably, the spike of the shoe is created by lofting multiple circles together.

####The back of the heel area was given a split because a zipper should be right there, but it's difficult to see in the reference.
