## Project 1: Primitives Robot, Date: August 26th, 2020

### Objective:
Design and build a robot using only primitive shapes and basic manipulations (move, rotate, and scale).

### Solution:
The Repulsor Grabber Mark 2, a theoretical mechanism with collapsible and articulated extremities.  This model features repulsors to effortlessly glide around and powerful grabbers to pick up items of interest.

When queried about their purpose, the artificial intelligence in this unit may have an existential melt down.
